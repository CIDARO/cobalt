## Status

**Cobalt** is currently in **1.0.0 version**. It has never been released and currently it's only an idea that we're developing. Please, please, please, **do not** use this in production unless you think it's useful for you!

---

## Description

**Cobalt** is an Open Source LRU Cache for Deno.

---

## TODO List

- [x] Basic LRUEntry
- [x] Basic LRUCache (get, set methods)
- [x] forEach, reverseForEach methods
- [x] has, pop, reset methods
- [ ] peek, load, keys, values methods
- [ ] stale entries management
- [ ] support different key/value types (or at least support serialization natively)

---

## Usage

### Import Cobalt object

In order to import Cobalt in your Deno code you must import it at the top:

```typescript
import { Cobalt } from "https://github.com/CIDARO/cobalt/blob/master/mod.ts";
```

### Create new Cobalt object

After you've imported Cobalt, initialize it with the following code:

```typescript
const cobalt = new Cobalt(); // With default 1000 capacity
const cobaltExpanded = new Cobalt(10000); // Override the default capacity
```

### Set, get and remove a key/value pair

With an instantiated Cobalt object you can **set**, **get** and **remove** a key/value pair:

```typescript
cobalt.set('key', 'test'); // Sets the value 'test' for the key 'test'
cobalt.get('key'); // Returns 'test'
cobalt.remove('key'); // Removes the key from the cache
cobalt.get('key'); // Returns null
```

### Run tests

In order to run the tests, just clone the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIDARO/cobalt.git
```

And then run the following code:

```bash
cd cobalt
deno test mod.test.ts
```

Hopefully everything will be ok!
